# Building Bridges

This project was developed in the context of a computer practical at university.

Sadly, I wasn't able to finish writing the tests and docs within that scope.

However you'll find what I've done at the following places:

 * Project itself: BuildingBridges.git/index.html
 * Documentation: BuildingBridges.git/doc/index.html
 * Test coverage: BuildingBridges.git/bin/coverage/html/index.html
 * Spec results: BuildingBridges.git/test/SpecRunner.html

I've used grunt while developing. You can derive the tasks from the Gruntfile.js.
